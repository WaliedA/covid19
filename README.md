# Scale Workspace Response to COVID19
In the span of four months, the Coronavirus has become an international pandemic. Since March 8th, over 114 cases have been reported in Louisiana with a high concentration in the Greater New Orleans area. As the spread of COVID-19 increases, this virus has a profound and lasting impact on local businesses, healthcare providers, and the community itself.

Despite these setbacks, Scale Workspace and their tenants have stepped up to help flatten the curve. As a New Orleans co-working space focused on product development, rapid manufacturing, and design services, Scale Workspace’s mission is creating innovative products through community assets.

Scale Workspace, Robert Forbes 3D, Entrescan and the New Curiosity Shop have been working on the following initiatives to assist with the local response to the COVID-19 pandemic:

## Medical Initiatives:
With the assistance of the [National Center for Advanced Manufacturing (NCAM)](https://lsu.edu/ncam/), our team has been prototyping Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) for Ochnser Health Systems in anticipation of shortages of critical equipment such as:

1) Masks / respirators

2) Face shields / eye guards

3) Ventilators

Our progress is detailed below, and all of our files will be available on our Github page. If you would like to provide assistance or require our services, please reach out to contact@scaleworkspace.com.

# Scale Workspace Response to COVID19
In the span of four months, the Coronavirus has become an international pandemic. Since March 8th, over 114 cases have been reported in Louisiana with a high concentration in the Greater New Orleans area. As the spread of COVID-19 increases, this virus has a profound and lasting impact on local businesses, healthcare providers, and the community itself.

Despite these setbacks, Scale Workspace and their tenants have stepped up to help flatten the curve. As a New Orleans co-working space focused on product development, rapid manufacturing, and design services, Scale Workspace’s mission is creating innovative products through community assets.

Scale Workspace, Robert Forbes 3D, Entrescan and the New Curiosity Shop have been working on the following initiatives to assist with the local response to the COVID-19 pandemic:

## Medical Initiatives:
With the assistance of the [National Center for Advanced Manufacturing (NCAM)](https://lsu.edu/ncam/), our team has been prototyping Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) for Ochnser Health Systems in anticipation of shortages of critical equipment such as:

1) Masks / respirators

2) Face shields / eye guards

3) Ventilators

Our progress is detailed below, and all of our files will be available on our Github page. If you would like to provide assistance or require our services, please reach out to contact@scaleworkspace.com.

## Daily Updates
### 3-20-2020

We’ve updated files on our Github page for the disposable mask and face shield, including a face shield file ideal for using on a CNC router. Robert Forbes 3D is also working with a regional supplier to make 500 face shields for delivery next week. We received feedback from the Ochsner team about the ventilator and are working on an update to allow two people to use 1 ventilator to mimic a hospital environment where only two patients will be in a room.

### 3-19-2020
Delivered 50 face shields to Ochsner. A product designer reached out about printing a component that allows 4 people to use 1 ventilator, which is now available on our Github page. We’re printing a prototype of that component for Ochsner to use tomorrow (3-20-2020). We’re also working actively with local partners such as Good Wood NOLA to produce large quantities of face shields for Ochsner and other entities who are in need.

### 3-18-2020
Uploaded files for [Face Shield Frame v2](https://github.com/scaleworkspace/covid19/tree/master/Face%20Shield/FaceShieldV2.1), which includes .stl, .step, .dxf, and renderings. There is also ReadMe instructions for the files.

### 3-17-2020
Uploaded files for [Respirator Style Mask](https://github.com/scaleworkspace/covid19/tree/master/DisposableMask?raw=true), [Disposable Mask](https://github.com/scaleworkspace/covid19/tree/master/DisposableMask?raw=true), and [Eye Shield](https://github.com/scaleworkspace/covid19/tree/master/EyeShield?raw=true).

We also purchased materials to help us produce a short run of disposable goods for Ochsner. The files we are using will be available online through our Github repository. We are currently working on a mask design with replaceable filters that should be available on Thursday.

### 3-16-2020 
Created prototypes of face shields and mask and submitted a face shield design to Ochsner for review.
